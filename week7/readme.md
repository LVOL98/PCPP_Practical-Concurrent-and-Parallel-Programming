# Lecture 7: Lock-free Data Structures

## Goals

The goals of this lecture are:

* Explain and use *compare-and-swap* (CAS) to solve concurrency problems.
* Explain and use `AtomicXX` Java classes.
* Design and use common lock-free data structures.

## Readings

* Goetz:
  * Chapter 15, complete.

* Herlihy:
  * Chapter 3, section 3.8.
  * Chapter 10, sections 10.5 and 10.6.
