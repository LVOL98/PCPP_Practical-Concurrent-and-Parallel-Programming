# Exercises Week 2

## Exercise 2.1
    Consider the Readers and Writers problem we saw in class. As a reminder, here is the specification of the problem:

    • Several reader and writer threads want to access a shared resource.
    • Many readers may access the resource at the same time as long as there are no writers.
    • At most one writer may access the resource if and only if there are no readers.
